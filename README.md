Here is my awesomewm setup.

It's built around floating windows.

Tiling features are intentionally stripped away.

Tiling is done manually through rules.

There's also no titlebars at all.

Instead there's right clicking the taskbar.

I make heavy use of the widgets and libraries that I wrote in "madwidgets".

You should be able to use madwidgets in other setups too, if you copy the whole thing.

To use, clone this in ~/.config

Rename the dir to "awesome".

Restart awesome.
